== Description ==

PICS (Picture Increment Cron System) is a WordPress Plugin designed to allow you to automatically post pictures to your WordPress blog at a administrator determined timed interval.

Have a bunch of photos that you want to show on your blog one at a time but you don¡¯t want to go through all the hassle of making a separate post for each picture? Then this is the WordPress Plugin you have been waiting for.

Requirements:

    * WordPress 2.5+ (Could work on lower versions, but we will only support the WordPress 2.5+.)
    * MySQL 5+ (Could work on 4.1.1 but we haven¡¯t tested it on that.)

Current Version: 1.0 (June 16, 2008)

WordPress Compatibility: Tested on WordPress 2.5.1

History:

One of us runs a website where they post a new photo every day from a very large collection. However, that same one person is pretty lazy when it comes to creating a new post for each photo. So this WordPress Plugin was the solution for that one persons laziness.

Features / Benefits:

    * User defined timed posting of images from a single directory.
    * Optional incremented title (ex. Vacation Photo # 1, Vacation Photo #2, Vacation Photo #1,345, etc¡­)
    * Increment starting number can be set to any numeric value.
    * Posts can be added to the categories of your choice.
    * Posts can have the tags of your choice.
    * Images can have the ALT tag of your choice.
    * Image directory can be set by user.
    * Images are chosen at random.
    * No image will be repeated. (Unless you have the same photo under different names.)

Installation Instructions:

   1. Upload
   2. Activate
   3. Go to Settings/PICS to set options
   4. That¡¯s it.

This is the post title that will be given to each image posted.

Interval:

Known Bugs:

    * None.

Link Love:

At the bottom of every third image posted there will be a small link saying ¡°Posted with PICS¡±. This link will have the style tag ¡°PICS¡± attached to it so you can change the color if you wish to something that blends into your theme.

Some people may not like showing this type of link love, but we have put a lot of work into this WordPress Plugin and we sincerely hope that the value of this plugin will outweigh any inconvenience caused.

This is the first of what we hope will be many useful WordPress Plugins. We truly hope that you will find this WordPress Plugin useful. If you have any questions or comments, we invite you to leave them below in the comments section.
